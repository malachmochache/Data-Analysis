# Module 2 Assignment: Salary Function

## Description

This project demonstrates data processing, error handling, and file operations in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R. The Python script imports the provided salaries csv data, gets an employee's details, exports them to a CSV file and saves it in a zipped folder. Uses R to unzip and display employee details.
